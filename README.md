# APITEST
Run the tests from Command Prompt 
Command "mvn surefire-report:report site -DgenerateReports=false"
This will generate sure fire reports in folder "APITEST\target\site\surefire-report.html"
with all testcases passing and the post request test will be failing because its still not implemented
